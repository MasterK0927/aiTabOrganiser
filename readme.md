# AI Tab Organiser

## Overview

Ever find yourself drowning in countless open tabs across multiple projects? AI Tab Organiser is here to save your time and provide you organised workspaces, all just in a single click, eliminating the fuss of organising tabs manually.

## Key Features

- **Workspace Creation**: Automatically group your tabs into meaningful workspaces, powered by similarity prediction algorithm. 
- **Easy Search**: Quickly find and switch between workspaces in a single click.
- **Tab Preservation**: Keep your tab collections safe and organized.

## How It Works?

### Analyzing Tabs

When you click the "Analyze Tabs" button, the extension:
1. Looks at your currently open tabs
2. Groups tabs based on their similarities, predicted by our Machine learning algorithm
3. Creates workspaces that make sense for your browsing habits

### Workspace Management

- **Rename Workspaces**: Click on the workspace name and type a new one
- **Open Workspace**: Switch to a specific set of tabs with one click
- **Delete Workspace**: Remove workspaces you no longer need

## Installation

<!-- ### From Chrome Web Store (Coming Soon!)
1. Open Chrome Web Store
2. Search "Tab Workspace Manager"
3. Click "Add to Chrome" -->

### Manual Installation
1. Navigate to `pack_extension` folder
2. Save the `.crx` file
3. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
4. Enable "Developer Mode"
5. Drag and drop the saved `.crx` file into `chrome://extensions/` window

### Common Issues

- **No Workspaces Created**:

  - Check browser permissions
